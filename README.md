#User Workflow:
1. A user logs in → a little animation that take user to
homepage.
2. Homepage has Duolingo/candy crush like levels, having
buttons like profile, study material. (its UI may like
monkeytype).
3. In profile: - we have user’s data badges, certificate, and
other details.
4. In Study material: - we have 7 modules with 3 or so
questions in each module.
5. At the end of 7th module, a certification exam of 7 questions
each from one module.
6. If passed gets a certificate.
7. In homepage: - each passing level gets us some points on
bases of which we get badges like clash of clans (bronze1,2;
silver1,2; gold1,2; diamond) with 7 levels and 8th upcoming
